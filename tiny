Hello, I am Rethik. In the next few minutes, I hope to paint a vivid picture of my journey over the past four months with Tinymagiq. As skeptical as I was in the beginning about the effectiveness of the quests and DLJs, I now feel that there was, in fact, a lot to benefit from by simply showing up and sticking to the tasks with consistency.

I first started noticing the difference when I began maintaining a streak of doing the BTGs and DLJs continuously. There was a slow shift that I began to notice. My threshold for what I consider urgent—and what is not—started to rise. More often than not, I had gotten used to putting things away until the deadline. “The job fills the time” was almost like my motto. But through the BTGs and DLJs I did, towards the latter half of the program, I started to realize just how limiting that mindset was.

Something unexpected also happened during the DLJs. On days when I sat down to write, I realized that I had nothing meaningful to report. And instead of brushing that off, I began taking small actions so that I *would* have something to write about. Things like reading a few pages of a book, or starting a course I had been putting off. These tiny choices didn’t feel like much at the time, but they slowly became habits. They were small, but they were intentional — and that intention mattered.

To add to this, through multiple instances in our weekly pod calls as well, I came to learn a simple but valuable lesson: “The early bird gets the worm.” And more importantly, being that early bird is *much* less stressful than constantly chasing deadlines. I started doing tasks earlier. Not because I had to, but because I began seeing them less as chores to finish off, and more as activities I would genuinely benefit from.

One of the biggest things I understand about myself now—something I didn’t fully recognize before—is how strongly I’m driven by clarity of purpose. I tend to look for the ‘why’ behind a task. Not just what I’m supposed to do, but where it fits in the bigger picture. When I can see the long-term value of what I’m doing, my motivation spikes. When I don’t, I either overthink it or delay acting on it. This training helped me recognize that pattern in myself. And once I saw it clearly, I could work with it instead of letting it control me.

If I were to give advice to my week-one self, it would be to approach new activities and challenges with an open mind. Not to walk in with rigid expectations, and not to try and predict everything. Trusting the process to teach me. During the first week, I was trying to categorize everything and make sense of it too quickly. If I could go back, I’d tell myself to relax a bit, trust the structure, and let the small daily actions build up. That would have saved me a lot of unnecessary resistance.

Looking back, these four months were not about big dramatic changes. They were about small, consistent, almost invisible shifts in how I respond to tasks, how I perceive urgency, and how I approach new challenges. And these tiny shifts—these have led to a mindset I genuinely want to carry forward.

Overall, this journey has given me more self-awareness, better habits, and a deeper appreciation for disciplined consistency. I may have started with skepticism, but I’m definitely ending with gratitude.

Thank you.
